        I started as a photographic assistant about 10 years ago and moved into digital operating/teching in 2015. I now feel
        very lucky to have worked / still work with some of the photography industries best and most talented people.

<main class="about">
    <p>
        I created Jaffa so that I could supply the same high quality service as a digital operator without having to
        rely on
        the
        quality of out sourced rental equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the moment I cannot sub hire equipment so all rentals will include myself at a day rate separate to rental
        costs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let me know if you want to work together.
    </p>

        Cheers<br>
